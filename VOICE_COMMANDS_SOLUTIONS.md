## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **Working Microphone Devices**
From troubleshooting, these devices work:
- **Device 1**: Microphone Array (2- Intel® Smart Sound Technology)
- **Device 5**: Primary Sound Capture Driver  
- **Device 6**: Microphone Array (2- Intel® Smart Sound Technology)

### **Voice Recognition Settings**
```python
# Optimized settings for PocketSphinx
energy_threshold = 300  # Higher threshold for better detection
timeout = 3
phrase_time_limit = 4
dynamic_energy_threshold = False  # Fixed threshold
pause_threshold = 0.8
```

### **Recognition Engines**
1. **PocketSphinx** (Primary) - Offline, reliable
2. **Google Speech Recognition** (Fallback) - Online, requires internet
3. **Keyboard Input** (Fallback) - Always works

## 🎮 **Usage Instructions**

### **Voice Commands**
1. **Start the system:**
   ```bash
   python main_with_working_voice.py
   ```

2. **Wait for initialization** (3 seconds)

3. **Use voice commands:**
   - Say **"follow me"** clearly
   - Say **"stop"** to stop following
   - Commands work offline with PocketSphinx

4. **Keyboard fallback:**
   - **F** key: Start following
   - **S** key: Stop following  
   - **Q** key: Quit system

### **Voice Command Tips**
- Speak clearly and at normal volume
- Wait for system to be ready (green status)
- Commands work in any language PocketSphinx supports
- System automatically detects speech and processes commands

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **If Voice Commands Don't Work:**

1. **Check microphone permissions:**
   - Windows: Settings > Privacy > Microphone
   - Allow desktop apps access to microphone

2. **Run microphone test:**
   ```bash
   python mic_troubleshooting.py
   ```

3. **Try different microphone:**
   - System automatically tries devices: 1, 5, 6
   - Check if microphone is connected and working

4. **Use keyboard fallback:**
   - F key: Follow
   - S key: Stop
   - Q key: Quit

5. **Check Windows audio settings:**
   - Right-click speaker icon > Open Sound settings
   - Test microphone input levels

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "listening timed out" | Speak louder or closer to microphone |
| "Could not understand audio" | Speak more clearly, try different words |
| "Microphone test failed" | Check microphone permissions and hardware |
| "No working microphones" | Try different USB microphone or check drivers |

## 🚀 **Advanced Configuration**

### **Custom Voice Commands**
Edit `tara_follow_system/voice_handler.py`:
```python
self.command_patterns = {
    CommandType.FOLLOW_ME: [
        "follow me", "follow", "come here", 
        "come follow", "start following"
    ],
    CommandType.STOP: [
        "stop", "stop following", "halt", 
        "freeze", "don't follow"
    ]
}
```

### **Microphone Device Selection**
Edit `tara_follow_system/voice_handler.py`:
```python
working_devices = [1, 5, 6]  # Change order or add devices
```

### **Recognition Settings**
Edit voice handler parameters:
```python
energy_threshold = 300      # Lower = more sensitive
timeout = 3                 # Longer = more time to speak
phrase_time_limit = 4       # Longer = longer commands
```
